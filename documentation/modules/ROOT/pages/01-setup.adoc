[#01-laboratory]
== Laboratory

The technical exercises included in this tutorial are based on cloud native solutions which are extensively used in the IT market. Please review the following list which includes the basics around these cloud native solutions:

- https://github.com/[GitHub] is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/[Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform with full-stack automated operations to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments. Red Hat OpenShift is optimized to improve developer productivity and promote innovation.
- https://tekton.dev/[Tekton] (Red Hat Pipelines Operator) is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premise systems.

During this tutorial, a set of resources are provided by the instructor in order to be able to complete the exercises described in the following sections. The main objective of these resources is to provide a platform, multiple templates and other resources which are required to create different objects in Openshift.

Please review the following list to have an overall understanding about the resources provided for completing this tutorial:

- An Openshift cluster that will host and make available a set of applications deployed
- A Tekton installation that will control the applications lifecycle automatically
- A set of GitHub repositories that include the templates to test Tekton features
  - https://github.com/davidseve/openshift-ci-cd-workshop/tree/main/03.OpenShift-Pipelines[GitHub - Openshift Pipelines Repository]

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI (which needs to be installed first) exposes the commands for managing your applications as well as the lower-level tools to interact with each component of your system.

Please review the previous settings with your instructor and connect to the cluster executing next command from your terminal:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u <user> -p <pass> <ocp_cluster_api>
----
